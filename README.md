# User Grid
Build a responsive React application that fetches a list of users from a public API and displays them using Material UI components. 

## Step 1: Fetch Data
Use the endpoint https://reqres.in/api/users to fetch user data.

Handle loading and error states appropriately.

## Step 2: Display Users
Use Material UI’s Card component to display each user. Read the Card component documentation in https://mui.com/material-ui/react-card/.

Each card should show:
- User’s avatar
- Full name
- Email address

Arrange the cards in a responsive grid layout using Material UI’s Grid system. Read the Grid component documentation in https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/.

### Example output:

<img src="./src/assets/usergrid.png" alt="User Grid" style="width: 50%;" />
